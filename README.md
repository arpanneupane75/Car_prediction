## About the Project

This project aims to build a robust predictive model for car prices using a dataset of various car attributes such as horsepower, engine size, fuel type, and more. It compares several regression models â€” including Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, SVR, KNN, and Polynomial Regression â€” to find the best-performing algorithm.

Users can interactively select important car features via a dynamic UI built with Streamlit and obtain a predicted price instantly.

## Features

- **Multiple regression models** available for prediction:
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - ElasticNet Regression

- **Dynamic UI** for feature input with:
  - Number inputs for numeric features with realistic value ranges
  - Radio buttons for categorical features with all available categories

- **One-hot encoding** and **scaling** consistent with training preprocessing for accurate predictions

- **Model details** and **coefficients** display for interpretability (for linear models)

- **Extensive metadata** management to ensure feature consistency and integrity

## Model Performance & Findings

| Model                 | RÂ² Score | RMSE       | MAE        | Notes                                           |
|-----------------------|----------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Lasso Regression**  | 0.7953   | 4020.17    | 2565.42    | Best overall performance with good feature selection and regularization |
| **ElasticNet**        | 0.7944   | 4029.21    | 2521.47    | Similar performance to Lasso, balances L1 and L2 penalties |
| **Ridge Regression**  | 0.7919   | 4053.01    | 2519.07    | Comparable to Lasso, favors smaller coefficients |
| **SVR**               | 0.7801   | 4166.12    | 2590.29    | Non-linear model, slightly less performant here |
| **KNN Regression**    | 0.2896   | 7488.73    | 3981.95    | Underperformed, likely due to curse of dimensionality |
| **Polynomial Regression** | -0.0337  | 9033.54    | 5521.99    | Poor fit, possibly overfitting or not suitable |

### Important Features Impacting Price

Top features influencing price prediction (confirmed by model coefficients and domain knowledge):

- **Horsepower**
- **Engine Size**
- **Curb Weight**
- **City MPG & Highway MPG**
- **Car Body Style**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Drive Wheel Configuration**

These features have significant influence on car pricing and were prioritized for UI input to enhance prediction relevance.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Implement confidence intervals or prediction uncertainty:** Provide users with an understanding of the model's confidence in its predictions.
*   **Add support for more granular feature inputs:** Incorporate additional car attributes such as manufacturing year, specific brand models, or trim levels.
*   **Integrate external APIs for live data fetching and updates:** Allow the application to fetch real-time car data or update its dataset periodically.
*   **Provide visualization of feature importance dynamically:** Display interactive charts showing which features have the most significant impact on car prices for the selected model.
*   **Deploy on cloud platforms for wider accessibility:** Make the application publicly available by deploying it on services like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
